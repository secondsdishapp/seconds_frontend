When you're working with a team on a front-end application cloned from a GitHub organization profile, you'll typically need to set up your local environment to ensure everything runs smoothly. Here’s a simplified checklist of what to do:

### Steps to Set Up Your Local Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Node.js**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   If you don't have it installed, download it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and install it.

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory (if not already there) and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Check for Additional Setup Instructions**:
   - Look for a `README.md` file or any other documentation in the repository. It may contain specific setup instructions or dependencies unique to the project.

5. **Environment Variables**:
   If your app requires any environment variables (e.g., API keys), you may need to create a `.env` file in the root directory. Refer to the documentation for details on what variables to include.

6. **Run the Application**:
   After installing dependencies, you can usually start the application with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Check the `package.json` for the correct script if it’s different.

### Optional: Install Development Tools
- **Linting/Formatting**: Install ESLint or Prettier if they are used in the project for consistent code style.
- **Testing Framework**: Set up any testing frameworks if the project has tests.

By following these steps, you should have a local copy of the front end set up and ready to contribute. Let me know if you need any further assistance!


Seconds App WireFrame for Mobile:
//Home Page
If not a member, the user can only see the dishes that are around and their ratings.. They can only sort that list from highest to lowest rating and from lowest to highest rating. And they can only search for a dish in the search bar.


How can we make a user sign up?

1. We can just show the list of nearby dishes with their ratings, but no address or restaurant name, that way if they click on it they'll get prompt to sign up or log in.

2. Do not show ratings for non members, just show address of dishes that have less than 5 stars in the database. If the user wants to see the top ones with all the info, they'll be prompted to sign up or log in.

Notes

Can a user rate the same dish multiple times?(Redundant to rate same dish (No). No multiple ratings. User can only change the rating).

How can we verify if the user actually ordered the dish in order to rate? (Future Feature?) Demo is about showing the positive possibilities. Panelist questions is to address bad aspects/possibilities. e.g. Future feature. api that can confirm legit receipts. AI may not be able to tell if receipt is real - that would skew the data.Give more insight to how complex might be, scale?

OCR
Map feature will be at the top based on location. (Mapbox/Google Maps) Google maps is way to go - more vendor focused.
